// Sheet census: a per-tab row-count reading taken during the fortnightly
// backup run so "when should a lane move off Sheets?" is answered by a number
// rather than a hunch. See docs/architecture/data/storage-boundary.md for the boundary
// this measures. This module only reads backup manifests and computes deltas;
// it never writes to Sheets.

// Machine-generated, event-heavy or concurrency-sensitive lanes flagged by the
// audit as the eventual/soon migration candidates. These are the tabs whose
// growth actually decides the migration trigger, so the census watches them
// explicitly. Human-paced config/workflow tabs are deliberately not here.
