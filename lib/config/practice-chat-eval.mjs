// Who sees a Practice Chat rating prompt, and how often.
//
// The six-week evaluation has two tiers. The silent tier — timings, errors,
// abandonment, edit rate — runs for everyone from day one and changes nothing a
// tutor sees. This file governs the *only* visible part: the rating card.
//
// It starts as Finn alone. Tutors join later, by agreement, and widening the
// roster is a Railway variable edit rather than a release. Deliberately
// resolved here rather than in the PWA, for the reason practice-note-sync.js
// already states: "The server decides which tutors are enabled. Do not
// duplicate a rollout allow-list in this public app." The launch URL therefore
// carries an opaque yes/no and a sampling number — never the roster.
//
// NEXT_PUBLIC_ values are inlined at build time, so changing either variable
// needs a rebuild to take effect. On Railway, editing the variable triggers one.

// 1 = prompt on every eligible session. Used for the first two weeks, when the
// only person being asked is also the person shaking down the instrument and a
// thin sample would tell him nothing.

// Cap. A number larger than this means someone typed a rate they did not mean,
// and a prompt nobody ever sees is worse than no prompt: it looks configured.
