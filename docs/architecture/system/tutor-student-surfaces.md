# Tutor and student surfaces

This describes the public `/dashboard` tutor surface and student portals reached
through friendly URLs or `/student/[studentId]`. They are production-critical
but deliberately lower-friction than `/admin`; read
[the security boundary](../security/tutor-student-surfaces.md) before adding data
or writes.

## Current capabilities

Tutor dashboard:

- self-select a tutor profile and load the current MMS roster;
- view a read-only daily MMS schedule and attendance context;
- search/open students, recent notes, Soundslice, Theta, and MMS;
- browse/assign catalogue songs and paths, reorder/status assignments, request a
  missing song, and optionally record an outcome;
- open Practice Chat with student and API handoff context.

Student portal:

- show the latest parent-visible First Chord practice note, with MMS fallback;
- show active assigned songs in tutor-defined order;
- open the student's Soundslice course and optional Theta access.

## Ownership

| Concern | Authority |
|---|---|
| Live tutor roster, lesson schedule, attendance | MMS |
| Tutor option/teacher-ID configuration | generated `ADMIN_TUTORS` data |
| Portal-friendly URL and course/Theta configuration | student registry and generated outputs |
| First Chord practice-note delivery/read state and explicit note-to-song links | `Practice_Notes_Log` and PostgreSQL delivery claim; MMS is historical-note fallback |
| Catalogue/path teaching content | repository song catalogue and path templates |
| Student song order/status | `Song_Assignments` |

The registry's tutor field groups portal configuration; it does not override the
MMS roster. Generated files are outputs—change the registry and regenerate.

## Main flows

```text
tutor selection
  -> /api/sync or /api/students
  -> cached MMS active-student search
  -> portal/song-link enrichment
```

```text
tutor + date
  -> /api/tutor-schedule
  -> bounded MMS calendar read
  -> read-only lesson/attendance summary
```

```text
student note read
  -> Practice_Notes_Log latest sent/completed note
  -> MMS fallback when no owned note exists
```

```text
Practice Chat music context
  -> current assigned/working/ready Song_Assignments
  -> exact shelf objects + bounded public catalogue search metadata
  -> deterministic note-title proposals, never preselected
  -> tutor confirms a catalogue ID or records an explicitly unlisted title
  -> server catalogue validation
  -> Practice_Notes_Log reviewed links/observations + read-only learning signals
```

```text
student songs
  -> token-guarded Song_Assignments
  -> join to repository catalogue
  -> hide parked/missing entries; fail safely to no song panel
```

## Trust and write boundary

Tutor selection is self-attested and remembered locally on the legacy public
service; it is not durable identity. The canonical service can enforce the
staged Google-login pilot. Its shared Finn/Tom account has full selection and
therefore proves an authorised operator, not an individual actor. Per-student
signed tokens still guard notes/song routes as defence in depth, but tokens
issued by the legacy public roster do not equal authenticated tutor accounts.

Allowed public-surface writes remain narrow:

- song/path assignment workflow state and optional learning evidence;
- Practice Chat's recipient-confirmed note/attendance/email flow under its
  dedicated delivery contract.

Do not add payment, archive, broad contact, student-state, messaging, or arbitrary
MMS writes before tutor authentication. Do not treat copied/generated notes as
proof of email delivery; check delivery state and claim records.
