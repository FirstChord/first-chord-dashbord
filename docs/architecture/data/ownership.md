# FirstChord Admin Ownership Matrix

Last updated: 2026-07-14

This document defines which layer currently owns each major action and field in the admin system.

Use it to reduce drift when implementing new features, resolving issues, or handing work between agents.

## Core Rule

- Many read surfaces, one admin write path.
- Google Sheets owns core operational student data.
- `students-registry.js` owns portal-specific configuration.
- MMS owns student status, billing profiles, and calendar lesson state.
- Stripe owns provider-side customer, subscription, invoice, and payment facts.
- Dashboard onboarding generates an FC ID for a new student and persists it in
  Sheets and the registry. A persisted ID must not be regenerated in the UI.
- `first-chord-brain` may still provide external batch reconciliation and
  `Review_Flags` generation, but it is not the sole owner of dashboard-created
  FC identity.
- Generated outputs should not be manually edited.

This matrix is detailed for student/onboarding actions. For the complete current
Sheets lane inventory, including finance, payroll, incoming messages, Practice
Chat, and planning, use `docs/architecture/data/state-tabs.md`.

## State Labels

- `authoritative`: the source of truth for the field or action in current operation
- `derived`: generated from another canonical source and not meant to be edited directly
- `transitional split ownership`: current V1 compromise where two systems hold related truth for different purposes and deliberate alignment is required

## Action Ownership

| Action | State | Canonical owner | Write method | Admin write surface | Downstream effect | Failure mode / conflict rule | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Add student | transitional split ownership | `Students` sheet + MMS + registry | onboarding workflow + external APIs | `/admin/onboard` | Creates Sheets row, registry entry, MMS activation, billing profile, first lesson | If Sheets write succeeds but later MMS steps fail, onboarding completes with warning and needs manual follow-up; this action should be prioritised for step tracking, retry logic, idempotency, and recovery rules | Current V1 onboarding flow and highest-value hardening target |
| Update student contact details | authoritative | `Students` sheet | manual dashboard edit | `/admin/students/[mmsId]` | Updates admin views and future sync consumers | If Sheets update fails, no partial registry fallback is attempted | Includes name, parent, email, phone |
| Update tutor assignment | transitional split ownership | `Students` sheet for operational truth, registry for portal truth | manual dashboard edit | `/admin/students/[mmsId]` | Resolves tutor conflicts, updates portal/admin consistency | If Sheets and registry differ, retain review flag until both are deliberately aligned | Current V1 reality is a transitional dual-write action; both lanes may need intentional updates |
| Update lesson length | authoritative | `Students` sheet | manual dashboard edit or onboarding workflow | `/admin/students/[mmsId]`, `/admin/onboard` | Affects operational lesson configuration | If MMS lesson state later differs, dashboard does not auto-reconcile | |
| Update instrument | transitional split ownership | `Students` sheet for operational display + registry for portal display | dashboard dual-write or onboarding workflow | `/admin/students/[mmsId]`, `/admin/onboard` | Affects admin context and portal behavior | Admin reads prefer the Sheet and fall back to registry; a partial dual-write must remain visible as a conflict rather than being silently merged | Both lanes are intentionally written today; field-level provenance is a future hardening target |
| Update Soundslice URL/code | authoritative | Registry | manual dashboard edit or onboarding workflow | `/admin/students/[mmsId]`, `/admin/onboard` | Affects student portal content | If registry write fails, do not silently fall back to Sheets | Not a Sheets field |
| Update Theta username | authoritative | Registry | manual dashboard edit or onboarding workflow | `/admin/students/[mmsId]`, `/admin/onboard` | Affects portal/login context | If registry write fails, do not silently fall back to Sheets | Not a Sheets field |
| Activate student in MMS | authoritative | MMS | external API via onboarding workflow | `/admin/onboard` | Moves student from waiting to active | If activation fails, keep onboarding warning visible; do not assume later MMS steps are safe | Done via API now |
| Create billing profile | authoritative | MMS | external API via onboarding workflow | `/admin/onboard` | Enables lesson creation and billing linkage | If billing profile creation fails, lesson creation may fail; surface warning and preserve prior successful writes | Done via API now |
| Create first lesson | authoritative | MMS | external API via onboarding workflow | `/admin/onboard` | Places lesson on calendar | Best-effort in V1; onboarding can still succeed without lesson creation | Done via API now |
| Resolve tutor conflict | transitional split ownership | Sheets + registry | manual dashboard edit | `/admin/students/[mmsId]` | Removes active issue from `/admin/flags` | Issue remains active until current live state matches across both sides | Dashboard now supports both tutor lanes |
| Delete orphaned portal entry | authoritative | Registry | manual dashboard edit | `/admin/flags` | Removes `REGISTRY ONLY` issue and registry entry | Only allowed for `REGISTRY ONLY`; do not delete MMS or Sheets records here | Safe delete only; does not touch MMS |
| Run external FC reconciliation / flag generation | derived | `first-chord-brain` batch tooling | terminal process outside this dashboard | No browser surface | May update FC exports and `Review_Flags` | Must not replace an existing persisted FC ID; resolve underlying mismatches rather than editing a derived flag | External compatibility path, not the dashboard onboarding owner |
| Regenerate dashboard configs | derived | Dashboard repo generation scripts | terminal/admin script | Manual terminal step | Updates derived config files and portal deployment path | Do not hand-edit derived config output to compensate for upstream errors | Not browser-triggered in V1 |

## Field Ownership

| Field | State | Canonical owner | Write method | Edited where | Derived / synced to | Failure mode / conflict rule | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Student first/last name | authoritative | `Students` sheet + MMS | manual dashboard edit + onboarding workflow + external API | Student detail, onboarding | Admin views, future sync logic | If systems diverge, treat it as a sync problem to fix deliberately rather than auto-overwriting | Keep aligned across systems |
| Parent/contact name | authoritative | `Students` sheet | manual dashboard edit + onboarding workflow | Student detail, onboarding | Admin use | If missing in MMS, do not infer from unrelated fields | |
| Email | authoritative | `Students` sheet + MMS | manual dashboard edit + onboarding workflow + external API | Student detail, onboarding | Admin use, future messaging | If different across systems, prefer deliberate correction over silent sync | |
| Phone number | authoritative | `Students` sheet + MMS | manual dashboard edit + onboarding workflow + external API | Student detail, onboarding | Admin use, future WhatsApp | Messaging workflows should not assume the number is valid without explicit confidence | |
| Tutor (operational) | authoritative | `Students` sheet | manual dashboard edit + onboarding workflow | Student detail, onboarding | Admin workflows | Dashboard display should continue to prefer Sheets tutor | Current display truth |
| Tutor (portal) | transitional split ownership | Registry | manual dashboard edit | Student detail | Student portal | Keep review flag active until Sheets and registry intentionally match | Can differ temporarily until resolved |
| Lesson length | authoritative | `Students` sheet | manual dashboard edit or onboarding workflow | Student detail, onboarding | Operational workflows | If later MMS billing/lesson state differs, treat as follow-up, not auto-rewrite | |
| Instrument | transitional split ownership | `Students` sheet for operational display; registry for portal display | dashboard dual-write or onboarding workflow | Student detail, onboarding | Admin context and student portal | Reads prefer the Sheet and fall back to registry; differences require deliberate reconciliation | Both lanes are written by current admin flows |
| `fcStudentId` | authoritative after generation | Persisted `Students` row + registry entry | dashboard `generateFcStudentId` during onboarding or missing-registry creation | Not manually editable in dashboard | Registry, FC exports, FC tabs | Never recompute an existing value; if persisted lanes disagree, stop and reconcile deliberately | Dashboard now owns generation for its onboarding path |
| `friendlyUrl` | authoritative | Registry | onboarding workflow, future manual dashboard edit if allowed | Onboarding, future admin editing if allowed | Student portal route | Must remain unique; collisions should be resolved intentionally | Portal-specific |
| `soundsliceUrl` | authoritative | Registry | manual dashboard edit or onboarding workflow | Student detail, onboarding | Student portal | If absent, portal can still exist but follow-up may be needed | |
| `thetaUsername` | authoritative | Registry | manual dashboard edit or onboarding workflow | Student detail, onboarding | Student portal | If absent or changed, do not infer from unrelated values after first save | |
| MMS status | authoritative | MMS | external API | Onboarding, future admin action | Waiting vs active workflows | If activation fails, keep student in follow-up state rather than pretending they are live | |
| Billing profile | authoritative | MMS | external API | Onboarding, future billing actions | Lesson creation | If billing profile is missing, lesson creation may fail and should surface clearly | |
| First lesson event | authoritative | MMS | external API | Onboarding | Calendar | Best-effort in V1; absence should surface as follow-up, not silent success | |
| Stripe customer/subscription IDs | authoritative | `Students` sheet currently | external system + trusted workflow only | Not exposed for editing in admin V1 | Payment workflows | Do not edit directly in V1 dashboard; any future repair path should be an explicit narrow admin tool | Keep tightly controlled |
| Review flags | derived | `first-chord-brain` generated into Sheets `Review_Flags` | generated by terminal/admin script | Not manually edited | `/admin/flags` | Resolve the underlying live mismatch; do not edit the generated flag row | Dashboard filters resolved issues live |

## Current V1 Boundaries

- Do not edit generated dashboard config files manually.
- Do not generate or recompute FC IDs in the UI except through the existing onboarding flow where already implemented.
- Do not delete MMS records from the flags page.
- `REGISTRY ONLY` deletes are currently the only destructive issue action exposed in the dashboard.
- Production onboarding writes the registry through the repository GitHub path;
  the registry workflow and deploy prebuild validate/regenerate derived config.
  Local registry changes still require `npm run generate-configs` before local
  portal verification.

## Shared Student Context Read Model

`lib/admin/student-context-helpers.mjs` is the shared deterministic composition
boundary used by Students, Issues, live Stripe issue scans, and explicit pause
reconciliation. It preserves the existing Sheet-first registry fallbacks and
adds runtime-only provenance for source role, cache freshness, inferred payment
fields, and Sheet/registry conflicts.

- Provenance describes how the current value was selected; it owns no truth and
  is never written back to Sheets or the registry.
- `Students` remains operational truth. Registry fallback does not silently
  repair a missing Sheet field.
- `Schedule_Context` remains a cached MMS projection. `checkedAt`, confidence,
  and freshness travel with the context; a `found` row is not live MMS truth.
- Lifecycle, payment value, pause coverage, and pause-expectation decisions are
  derived values.
- Raw student context includes sensitive contact and provider identifiers. Any
  future assistant read must use a separate redacted projection defined in
  `docs/architecture/ai/tool-contracts.md`.

## Future Direction

- Keep the admin dashboard as the main human write surface.
- Keep reusable business rules in tested deterministic modules with narrow
  integration boundaries; do not move ownership merely to create an AI layer.
- Keep specialist tools like Payment Pause and future messaging flows on top of the same shared ownership model.
- Expand this matrix when adding:
  - payments issue detection
  - WhatsApp-triggered workflows
  - agent-assisted triage or recommendations
