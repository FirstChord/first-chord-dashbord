# School Policy

## Purpose

These are school-level operating rules that implementation must preserve. Field
semantics, calculations, UI patterns, and recovery details belong in their
focused documents.

## Student And Tutor Identity

- One student normally maps to one tutor.
- If a student genuinely studies separately with two tutors, prefer two MMS
  student identities and two portal/dashboard identities.
- Missing or conflicting tutor records must be shown and resolved, not guessed.
- Test students remain explicitly flagged; never infer them from a name.

## Onboarding

A student is operationally onboarded only when:

- the `Students` row and registry entry exist
- MMS student state is active
- the MMS billing profile is ready
- the first lesson has been created

Stripe linkage is a separate payment-setup workflow and may complete after the
first lesson. A Stripe-managed setup becomes overdue for review seven days after
the first lesson.

Onboarding crosses Sheets, registry/GitHub, and MMS and can partially succeed.
Show every step result and recovery action; never collapse warnings into
unconditional success.

## Lessons, Cancellation, And Leaving

- The first lesson is paid before the slot is secured.
- A student cancellation with at least one week's notice is not charged.
- For shorter notice, the normal fallback may be a Zoom lesson in the existing
  slot or tutor practice video; same-day cancellation/no-show is not eligible
  for a practice video.
- A tutor cancellation requires the explicit cover-or-cancel workflow. If
  cancelled, payment handling and truthful parent confirmation remain human
  actions.
- Families ending lessons are asked for two lessons' notice.

One-off lesson moves are not offered as swaps/make-ups. A permanent schedule
change is welcome and routed to a human to find a sustainable slot.

## Pauses And Holidays

Pause windows are evaluated against usual lesson dates. Outside July/August, a
break may normally pause payment for up to three weeks; weeks four and five are
charged, and a break of six weeks or more normally releases the slot. Summer is
handled separately from that extended-break rule.

The school normally teaches through bank holidays and summer. The standard
school-wide closure is two weeks at Christmas; Easter/summer absences are
student- or tutor-specific unless explicitly declared otherwise.

`Pause History`, Sheets payment expectation, and live Stripe state are distinct
evidence. Their alignment and reconciliation rules are in
[Payments](./payments.md). Tutor-cancellation grouping is in the
[absence contract](../workflows/tutors/absence-to-pause.md).

## Payments

Stripe is the normal recurring-payment method. Approved manual-payment cases
remain exceptions until explicitly changed and must not receive Stripe-failure
alarms. A first failed payment is reviewable evidence because Stripe may retry;
no parent action follows automatically.

Current prices and provider mechanics belong in administered configuration and
the payment/onboarding implementation, not duplicated policy prose. The
canonical payment state and action boundaries are in [Payments](./payments.md).

## Communications

Parent communication is approval-first. Drafting, classification, or copying
does not prove a message was sent. WhatsApp remains human copy/send.

Practice Chat lesson-note email is the narrow automated-send exception: the
tutor reviews the note, the final screen names the student and server-derived
parent recipient, and the tutor explicitly confirms that delivery. It does not
permit automated payment, pause, onboarding, marketing, or general messaging.

See [Practice Chat delivery](../workflows/practice-chat/delivery.md) and
[Copy and tone](./copy-and-tone.md).

## Automation Boundary

The system must not automatically send parent messages, execute payment, alter
payment expectation, change student/tutor/lesson state, archive a student, or
resolve operational work from unreviewed text or AI output.

Consequential actions require current authoritative evidence, deterministic
validation, the established human preview/confirmation, and an audit record.
When evidence conflicts, preserve source, identifiers, freshness, and
uncertainty rather than silently choosing a winner.

Repository-wide engineering boundaries are in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) and
workflow interaction rules are in [Workflow design](./workflow-design.md).
