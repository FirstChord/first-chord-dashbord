# Hygiene And Secrets

## Repository Boundary

Use `/Users/finnlemarinel/Desktop/FirstChord/music-school-dashboard` as the real
repository. `/Users/finnlemarinel` is also a Git working tree with an old remote;
a broad add/commit there could include unrelated personal files. Never commit
from or alter that home-directory repository without Finn's explicit approval.

Before every commit, inspect `git status --short` and the staged diff. Never add
`.env*`, provider tokens, OAuth files, local WhatsApp state/logs, or Sheets
backups.

## Known Historical Exposures

- `lib/config/theta-credentials.js` used to be tracked. It is now generated,
  ignored, and derived from the student registry, but old values remain in Git
  history. Decide whether portal credentials/password policy require rotation.
- `lib/mms-client.js` used to contain an MMS bearer/API-key token. Runtime now
  reads `MMS_BEARER_TOKEN`, but the historical token should be rotated when
  integrations can be smoke-tested safely.
- the Practice Chat transcription relay currently returns its raw OpenAI key to
  browsers. Treat the key as exposed and complete the staged server-side
  transcription/rotation plan in a no-lessons window.

Do not rewrite repository history casually. Rotate affected credentials and
record the operational decision.

## Secret Rules

- Railway/provider consoles and the password manager own secret values; docs own
  only variable names, scopes, symptoms, and recovery routes.
- Keep local runtime values in ignored `.env.local`/tool-specific files.
- Never expose a server secret through `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, browser JSON, logs,
  screenshots, fixtures, or error messages.
- Provider keys use the minimum permissions required by their focused workflow.
- A shared ingest/PWA secret is a coarse caller gate, not a user identity.
- OpenAI pilots use a dedicated budget-capped project key. Do not reuse the
  exposed Practice Chat relay key; understand that `store: false` does not remove
  provider abuse-monitoring retention.
- Suspected exposure means disable/rotate first, then inspect privacy-safe
  metadata. Do not paste the secret into an incident note.

The current variable inventory and rotation/smoke routes are in the
[operations runbook](../operations/runbook.md). AI-specific scope and retention
are in [runtime integration](../architecture/ai/runtime-integration.md).

## Generated And Local Data

Do not edit generated registry artifacts to mask upstream problems. Change
`lib/config/students-registry.js` through the normal onboarding/archive path and
regenerate. `lib/config/theta-credentials.js` stays ignored.

Operational surfaces use explicit `is_test_student`/`isTestStudent` flags. Do
not infer test records from names or delete provider/Sheets records automatically.

`npm run backup:sheets` writes personal data under ignored `backups/sheets/`.
WhatsApp auth/cache/log directories also contain credentials or parent content.
Keep them private, apply the data-protection retention window, and use
[disaster recovery](../operations/disaster-recovery.md) for restore handling.

## Pre-Deploy Hygiene

Run `npm run hygiene:check`, inspect generated diffs after any config-generating
command, and smoke every integration affected by a credential/config change.
Never weaken a hygiene check to ship a secret-bearing diff.
