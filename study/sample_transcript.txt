User: What is the quadratic formula?

Tutor: The quadratic formula is used to solve quadratic equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0. The formula is:

x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)

Where:
- a, b, and c are coefficients from the quadratic equation
- The ± symbol means there are usually two solutions
- The expression under the square root (b² - 4ac) is called the discriminant

User: What does the discriminant tell us?

Tutor: The discriminant (b² - 4ac) tells us about the nature of the solutions:
- If discriminant > 0: Two distinct real solutions
- If discriminant = 0: One repeated real solution  
- If discriminant < 0: No real solutions (two complex solutions)

User: Can you show me an example with x² - 5x + 6 = 0?

Tutor: Sure! For x² - 5x + 6 = 0, we have:
- a = 1, b = -5, c = 6

First, let's check the discriminant:
b² - 4ac = (-5)² - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1

Since discriminant = 1 > 0, we have two distinct real solutions.

Using the quadratic formula:
x = (5 ± √1) / (2·1) = (5 ± 1) / 2

So: x = (5+1)/2 = 3 or x = (5-1)/2 = 2

Therefore, x = 2 or x = 3
