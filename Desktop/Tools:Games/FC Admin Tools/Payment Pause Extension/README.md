## Troubleshooting

### "Content script not loaded" Error
**Cause**: MyMusicStaff page is not open or extension needs refresh

**Fix**:
1. Open MyMusicStaff in a tab and log in
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click reload icon on this extension
4. Try again

### Student Not Found
**Cause**: Student might not be in the database or name is misspelled

**Fix**:
1. Check spelling (try first name only, then last name only)
2. Verify student exists in Google Sheets database
3. If recently added, clear cache:
   - F12 ‚Üí Console ‚Üí Run: `chrome.storage.local.remove(['student_database_cache'])`
   - Reload extension

### "401 Unauthorized" Error
**Cause**: API token has expired or is invalid

**Fix**:
1. Contact admin to update API token in code
2. Reload extension after token is updated

### Dates Not Appearing
**Cause**: JavaScript error or cache issue

**Fix**:
1. Reload extension (`chrome://extensions/` ‚Üí reload icon)
2. Hard refresh MyMusicStaff page
3. Check console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)

### Subscription Pause Fails
**Cause**: Student might not have active Stripe subscription

**Fix**:
1. Check Stripe dashboard for active subscription
2. Use "MyMusicStaff Only" mode if no Stripe subscription
3. Verify student email matches Stripe customer email

### Search Results Are Slow
**Cause**: Cache might have expired

**Fix**:
- First search after cache expiry takes 2-3 seconds (loading from Google Sheets)
- Subsequent searches are instant (< 0.5s)
- Cache lasts 24 hours, then auto-refreshes

## Current Limitations

### No Future-Dated Pauses
**Limitation**: Can only pause subscriptions starting immediately (today)

**Example**: Can't schedule "pause starting in 2 weeks" today

**Workaround**:
1. Create calendar blocks now (MyMusicStaff Only mode)
2. Set reminder to pause Stripe subscription on start date
3. Come back and run Full Automation on that date

**Planned Fix**: Implementing Stripe Subscription Schedules (coming soon)

### Manual WhatsApp Messaging
**Limitation**: Must manually copy/paste message to WhatsApp

**Workaround**:
1. Click "Copy Message" button
2. Open WhatsApp web or mobile
3. Find parent chat
4. Paste message (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V)

**Future Enhancement**: WhatsApp Business API integration (not planned yet)

### Single School Only
**Limitation**: Hardcoded for First Chord Music School only

**Note**: By design - this is an internal tool, not a product

## FAQ

### Who can use this extension?
First Chord admin staff only (currently 2 people). Not for parents or tutors.

### Does this work on other music schools?
No, it's hardcoded for First Chord's MyMusicStaff account and Stripe account.

### Can I pause multiple students at once?
Not yet. Currently one student at a time. Bulk operations may be added in future.

### What happens to payment when I pause?
Stripe automatically issues a prorated refund for the unused days. When subscription resumes, billing continues as normal.

### Can I undo a pause?
Yes, but you'll need to:
1. Manually delete calendar blocks in MyMusicStaff
2. Manually resume subscription in Stripe dashboard
3. Future: May add "Unpause" button to extension

### How do I update student information?
Update the Google Sheets database. Extension will automatically pick up changes (within 24 hours, or clear cache for immediate update).

### Is student data secure?
Data is cached locally on your computer (chrome.storage.local). Only accessible to you. API keys are hardcoded (internal tool only - not for public distribution).

### Can I use this on Firefox or Safari?
No, it's Chrome-only (uses Chrome extension APIs). Could be ported to Firefox with some modifications, but Safari would be difficult.
