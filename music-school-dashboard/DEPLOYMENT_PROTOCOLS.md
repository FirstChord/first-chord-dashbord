# üöÄ Music School Dashboard - Deployment Protocols

## Overview
This document contains all deployment and maintenance protocols for the Music School Dashboard project.

## üìã Railway Deployment Protocol

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
Before deploying, always run through this checklist:

```bash
# 1. Check git status (ensure all changes are committed)
git status

# 2. Test build locally
npm run build

# 3. Verify Railway connection
railway status
```

### Expected Outputs:
- **Git Status**: Should show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
- **Build**: Should complete with "‚úì Compiled successfully"
- **Railway Status**: Should show project and service names (not "Service: None")

### Deployment Steps

```bash
# Step 1: Verify Railway connection
railway status

# Step 2: If "Service: None" appears, re-link the project
railway link
# Select: efficient-sparkle project & efficient-sparkle service

# Step 3: Deploy
railway up

# Step 4: Monitor deployment
# Build logs URL will be provided in terminal output
# Live site: https://efficient-sparkle-production.up.railway.app
```

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Select template to deploy" appears | Run `railway link` first |
| "Service: None" in status | Run `railway link` and select correct project/service |
| Deploy command hangs | Use Railway web dashboard or ctrl+c and retry |
| Build fails | Check build logs URL provided in output |

### Quick Commands Reference
